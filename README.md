# Speed_Dating_Match_Prediction
## Data Mining
predict the outcome of a specific speed dating session based on the profile of two people, so we can implement a recommendation system to better match people in speed dating events. Participants attended a dating event where they had a 4-minute date with every other participant of the opposite sex who attended the same event. The participants decided to accept or reject their partners. If both the participant and partner matched, they received each other's contact information. Participants rated their partners on six personal attributes: attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambition, and shared interests. Before and after the event, participants rated their preferences in the six attributes and gave themselves ratings. Other information was collected about the participants' backgrounds and preferences.
